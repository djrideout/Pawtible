Mode 2's length is constant â€“ 80 T cycles, 2 cycles per entry in OAM. Mode 1 is constant as well; (456 * 10 T cycles). It never changes.

Mode 3 works this way:

    Base length of 172 T cycles

        (SCX & 7)

        6 T-cycles per sprite on that line

        For each sprite, there may be a penalty of up to 5 T-cycles for stopping the background fetcher, which depend on that sprite's X positions. Two sprites that share the same X position only "pay" the penalty once.

    There probably is a penalty of up to 8 T-cycles if the window is visible on that line, but I haven't properly tested and verified it yet.

    Mode 0 is takes whatever it takes to reach 456 T-cycles

A few more notes:

    The PPU can read from OAM and VRAM at a 2 MHz rate

    However, it has a 16-bit bus to OAM so it can read 2 bytes in just one T-cycle

    The PPU pushes pixels to the LCD screen at 4MHz, i.e. 4 pixels per NOP assuming the PPU didn't stall

    On a CGB, sprites will affect timing even if disabled. This does not occur on the DMG.

    The CGB PPU had major differences introduced in revision D. It appears that AntonioND's doc describe CGB-CPU-C and lower.
